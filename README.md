HangarShip a fairly rudimentary mod for Jump Ship by Keepsake Games.
This is my first mod for the game and it has a few issues still but it works.
Installation is done via MelonLoader[https://melonwiki.xyz/#/], simply drag and drop the dll into your mods folder once installed.

Known issues:
Doors must be opened from outside once before the inside panel works
Ship customization doesnt register until hangar is reloaded
First cutscenes no longer display the ship

I will be working to fix some of these issues but i dont believe some of them can be easily fixed.
If you discover any more bugs, please dm me on discord (graciouscub5622)

Thank you for tring out my mod!
